Well since I am making a blog site why not keep my todo list here

* SEO description - should be a ` A one to two sentence description of your object`. Currently uses the same description for everything.
* Fix responsivity
* Fix colors
* Fix deployment
* Add katex / latex thing
* Fix fonts
* Add favicon
* Enable SES // newsletter
* Add RSS?? (well not in near future)

And then I can just **write**???
